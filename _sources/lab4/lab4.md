# Lab 4: EDS in the SEM


Welcome to Lab 4!
This lab finally departs from X-ray diffraction, although you've noticed that spectroscopy still plays an important role. 
Since the SEM micrographs are not particularly interesting, we don't have a great opportunity to work with computer vision tools in this analysis, but we'll still demo something that we think is cool (purely to pique your interest).
Furthermore, the analysis isn't particularly extensive in this lab, so we'll focus on some fine-tuning of your plots.
