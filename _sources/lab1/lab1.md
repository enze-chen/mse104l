# Lab 1: X-ray emission and absorption

Welcome to Lab 1!
For this lab, we will be writing some Python code to help analyze your X-ray emission and absorption data.
Because there are a lot of spectra and plots involved in the writeup, we'll focus this lab on **data visualization** in Python.
The primary objectives are:
- Create plots of your data with the Matplotlib library. 
- Articulate and apply fundamental data visualization principles.
