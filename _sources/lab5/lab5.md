# Lab 5: Self-guided experiments


Welcome to Lab 5!
It's up to you to decide what experiments you want to run and what data are helpful to collect, but we hope the programming tools we've introduced here will assist with making beautiful figures for your poster!

Note that to create a new Jupyter notebook in DataHub, navigate to any folder (📁 > `mse104l` > `lab5`) and click <kbd>New ▼</kbd> > `Python 3 (ipykernel)`.
You can directly start typing code as we've already discussed.
