    "This growth is in part due to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Its _readability_. Python is designed to be simple and reads like English, using common keywords instead of symbols (e.g., `and` vs. `&&`).\n",
    "1. Its _extensibility_. Python makes it easy for developers to write _modules_ that extend its functionalities for applications in data science, [scientific computing](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2649-2), [imaging black holes](https://numfocus.org/case-studies/first-photograph-black-hole), and [flying drones on Mars](https://twitter.com/ThePSF/status/1362516507918483458?s=20).\n",
