# Lab 2: Powder X-ray Diffraction


Welcome to Lab 2!
You will be analyzing more X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra in this lab, so you will be applying all of the skills you learned in the previous lab.
Moreover, there are a few calculations that you will have to do in order to determine the crystal structure (e.g., computing lattice constants), which gives us an opportunity to teach you how to work with tabular data in Python, a very useful skill.
You may find that these techniques are helpful for your homework as well. ðŸ˜‰
