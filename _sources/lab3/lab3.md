# Lab 3: Precision X-ray Diffractometry


Welcome to Lab 3!
In this lab you are working with Cu–Ni alloys, which form an FCC solid solution at all compositions.
You'll be getting more practice with some of the programming techniques that we introduced in previous labs.

The primary objectives of these notebooks are:
- Use functions to automate the commands from Lab 2 to repeatedly process Cu–Ni data.
- Calculate a correlation coefficient to quantify linearity.
