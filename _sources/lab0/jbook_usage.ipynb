    "### Why Python? üêç\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many programming languages one can choose from, and we eventually settled on Python as it has [skyrocketed in popularity](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/06/incredible-growth-python/) in recent years.\n",
    "This growth is in part due to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Its _readability_. Python is designed to be simple and reads like English (e.g., `and` instead of `&&`).\n",
    "1. Its _extensibility_. Python makes it easy for developers to write _modules_ that extend its functionalities for applications in [data science](https://wesmckinney.com/book/), [scientific computing](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2649-2), [imaging black holes](https://numfocus.org/case-studies/first-photograph-black-hole), and [flying drones on Mars](https://twitter.com/ThePSF/status/1362516507918483458?s=20).\n",
    "1. Its _open-source_ properties. This means anyone can contribute to Python development and anyone can use it‚Äîfor free!\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "There are many similarities between Python and MATLAB, but the latter doesn't interface well with Jupyter Book/Hub (yet).\n",
    "You could conceivably follow these instructions and write analogous code in MATLAB, but we invite you to give Python a try in the JupyterHub, and we're banking on the fact that open-source codes (e.g., Python, Julia) will only become more prominent in your future work.\n",
