```{admonition} Questions/comments/ideas?
:class: tip
Let us know!
This is only the first draft and we're happy to hear your feedback.
You can open an issue on GitHub or email Enze (`chenze@`).
```

We have prepared these **optional** programming exercises to accompany the laboratory procedures in MATSCI 104L.
Completing them is _not_ a requirement for any of the labs and you will _not_ be assessed on programming concepts in MATSCI 104/L.
That being said, we hope these exercises can be helpful guides for your data analysis and teach you something new‚Äîmaybe even lead to a grade boost. üí°


## Purpose

````{margin} 
```{admonition} Group work 
:class: note 
It is totally fair game to work together on the analysis, particularly to help each other with Python syntax and debugging.
We hope the online, uniform interface can encourage group work; 
however, please be sure to write your own code, generate your own plots, and complete your own lab writeup with [honesty and integrity](https://teaching.berkeley.edu/berkeley-honor-code).
```
````

Several students who have taken MATSCI 104L in the past have appreciated the hands-on experimental procedures, but wished that there could also be more guidance during the data analysis portion to facilitate the writeup. 
Because we care about your feedback and success in this course, we have tried to accommodate this request, albeit with a slight twist. 
Namely, we hope to **provide greater clarity for the analysis**, but we will do so in the context of **teaching you some data science (DS) and scientific communication (SC)** skills as well.
We believe this will help you complete your lab reports and give you transferable skills that can be applied to other pursuits.


## Learning outcomes 

We hope these exercises will help you grow in the following ways:    
üìä Create some hella nice plots based on effective data visualization principles.      
üìù Incorporate visualizations and statistical analyses of data to strengthen SC.     
ü§ñ Apply computational tools to streamline and automate the analysis of MSE data.     
üß∞ Develop basic proficiency with common Python packages for DS‚Äîanother tool to add to your toolbox.     


## Usage  

If this is your first time using Jupyter Book/Hub, and particularly if it's your first time using Python, we suggest you take a look at the **tutorials** in the next few pages. 
We've made a few notebooks that you might find helpful: {doc}`lab0/jbook_usage` and {doc}`lab0/intro_python_jupyter_blank`.
Otherwise, you can proceed to {doc}`lab1/lab1` and get started.
Have fun!
