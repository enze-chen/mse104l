# Lab 2: Powder X-ray Diffraction


Welcome to Lab 2!
You will be analyzing more X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra in this lab, so you will be applying all of the skills you learned in the previous lab.
Moreover, there are a few calculations that you will have to do in order to determine the crystal structure (e.g., computing lattice constants), which gives us an opportunity to teach you how to work with tabular data in Python, a very useful skill. üêº
You may find that these techniques are helpful for your homework as well. üòâ

The primary outcomes of these notebooks are:
- Apply more Matplotlib commands to fine-tune your plots.
- Use basic functions associated with pandas and DataFrames to work with tabular data.

```{tip}
If this is your first week using these supplementary exercises, it might be helpful to first skim through the exercises from last week ({doc}`../lab1/lab1_exercises_blank`) or the previous tutorials (e.g., {doc}`../lab0/intro_python_jupyter_blank`, {doc}`../lab1/intro_plotting_blank`). Enjoy!
