# MSE 104L Data Analysis

*Authors: [Enze Chen](https://enze-chen.github.io/) and [Andrew Minor](https://mse.berkeley.edu/people_new/minor/) (University of California, Berkeley)*


These are a series of programmatic exercises in Python meant to guide students through the data analysis in MSE 104L: Materials Characterization Laboratory.
It is designed using the open-source [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) software and interactivity is made possible with the generous support of the [DataHub](https://datahub.berkeley.edu/) program at UC Berkeley (non-Berkeley students may also use [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/)).
