    "\n",
    "In the previous lab, you had to calculate the lattice constant and apply the Nelson-Riley method for your samples with cubic crystal structure.\n",

    "Of course, if you did the programming solution last time, you'll have no problem with this part of the lab. üòÅ\n",
    "There are two ways to go about this:\n",
    "1. (_Works_) You can copy-paste the individual code sections from the previous lab into a single code block and just run it repeatedly, with different peak positions (corresponding to different Cu‚ÄìNi samples), to get lattice constants through Nelson-Riley.\n",
    "1. (_Slightly more preferred?_) You can do something slightly fancier and **write a function** that makes things look cleaner as you repeat the steps.\n",

    "def function_name(args):\n",
