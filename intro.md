# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

These exercises are meant to accompany the laboratory procedures in MSE 104L.


```{tip}
These exercises are very much a work in progress, so if you have suggestions for how to improve things or other analysis that you would like to see, please let us know.
```


## Navigating the curriculum

For the most part, you can use the navigation panel on the left to jump quickly to the exercise you're interested in. 
The `Lab X` pages will have a more detailed summary of all of the associated exercises for that lab, which can be expanded by clicking the down chevron (âŒ„).

Most of the curriculum will be accessible to everyone through the campus JupyterHub. 
If you want to view the source code of this textbook, you can hover over [Octocat](https://github.com/octocat) in the top-right corner and click {guilabel}`repository` or [click here](https://github.com/enze-chen/mse104l).



### Note on external links

The default behavior of Jupyter Book/Sphinx/HTML is to open all links _in the current tab_, so if you want to open external links in a new tab, you will have to `Ctrl+Click` the link or right click and select {guilabel}`Open link in new tab`.
Otherwise you'll have to keep clicking the â¬… button in your browser to return to (and reload) the Jupyter Book.
