# Lab 5: Self-guided experiments


Welcome to Lab 5!
It's up to you to decide what experiments you want to run and what data are helpful to collect, but we hope the programming tools we've introduced here will assist with making beautiful figures for your poster! 🤩

You can also create your own Jupyter notebooks in DataHub.
Just navigate to any folder (e.g., 📁 > `mse104l` > `lab5`) and click <kbd>New ▼</kbd> > `Python 3 (ipykernel)`.
You can directly start typing code as we've already discussed.
