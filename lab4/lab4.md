# Lab 4: EDS in the SEM


Welcome to Lab 4!
This lab finally departs from X-ray diffraction and you should feel pretty confident about data analysis and visualization at this point. 
Since the SEM images are not particularly interesting or high quality, we don't have a great opportunity to work with computer vision tools in this analysis, but we'll still demo something that we think is cool to pique your interest.

The primary objectives of these notebooks are:
- Apply more Matplotlib commands to fine-tune your plots.
- Run a basic machine learning algorithm ($k$-means) for image segmentation (**not** a part of your lab report).
