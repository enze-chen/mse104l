    "### Create Figure and Axes objects\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1**: There are many ways to create figures using Pyplot, but in true OOP fashion, the **best practice** is to create [`Figure`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/figure_api.html#matplotlib.figure.Figure) and [`Axes`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/axes_api.html#matplotlib.axes.Axes) objects using the [`plt.subplots()`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.subplots.html) function like so:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Figure` (`fig` variable) is the top-level container for all plot elements while the `Axes` (`ax` variable) is the object for a particular plot.\n",
    "`plt.subplots()` creates both of these objects, which we then assign to the variables on the left.\n",
    "Imagine this step as the IRL-equivalent of saying, \"Before we can paint a painting, we must fetch a new canvas.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2**: To make a plot, we can call a method like [`ax.plot(x, y)`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.axes.Axes.plot.html) **directly using the `Axes` object**‚Äî_not_ `fig` or `plt`.\n",
    "This standard method plots $y$ vs. $x$ points and, by default, connects the points with lines in the order that they're plotted.\n",
    "Note the syntax for `ax.plot()` is a list (or array) of $x$-coordinates and _then_ a list of $y$-coordinates, **not** a list of $(x,y)$ pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3**: Finally, and perhaps unintuitively, we have to call [`plt.show()`](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.show.html) to actually display the plot.\n",
    "Matplotlib can be quite literal!\n",
    "As we shall soon see, this is also what makes it shine. üíñ\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "We've done too much talking, so let's put this into practice!\n",
    "Here's a few lines of code to plot $y = x ^ 2$ for the first five positive integers."
