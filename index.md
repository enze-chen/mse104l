# Welcome! 👋


````{margin} 
```{admonition} We need your help!
:class: tip
These exercises are very much a work in progress, so if you have suggestions, please let us know.
You can open an issue on GitHub or email Enze (`chenze@`).
```
````

We have prepared these **optional** programmatic data science (DS) exercises to accompany the laboratory procedures in MSE 104L.
Again, these are _truly optional_ and completing them is not a requirement for any of the labs; 
you also will **not** be assessed on Python/DS in MSE 104/L.
That being said, we hope these exercises can be helpful guides for your analysis and teach you something new—maybe even lead to a grade boost. 💡


## Purpose

````{margin} 
```{admonition} Group work 
:class: note 
It is totally fair game to work together on the analysis, particularly to help each other figure out the code / debug.
That's another reason for this online, uniform interface. 
Please generate your own plots and complete your own writeup with [honesty and integrity](https://teaching.berkeley.edu/berkeley-honor-code).
```
````

Several students who have taken MSE 104L in the past have appreciated the hands-on experimental procedures, but wished that there could also be more structured guidance during the data analysis portion to facilitate the writeup. 
Because we care about your feedback and your success in this course, we have tried to accommodate this request, albeit with a slight twist. 
Namely, we hope to **provide greater clarity for the analysis**, but we will do so in the context of **teaching you some data science** skills as well.
This will not only help you complete your lab reports, but it will also give you transferable skills that you can use for other tasks.


## Learning outcomes 

We hope these exercises will help you grow in the following ways: 🌱
- Create some hella nice plots based on effective data visualization principles. 📊
- Develop basic proficiency with common Python packages for DS—another tool to add to your toolbox. 🧰
- Apply computational tools to streamline and automate the analysis of MSE data. 🤖


<!-- ### Intended audience

Students will be coming into MSE 104L with a whole range of experiences in programming, so we will broadly outline some user personas and how you might stand to benefit:
- You do not care for coding: Well, OK, maybe you can just stop reading now. 
Or you can give the first exercises a try with an open mind and see if we can change your mind. 🙂
- You are interested but have no experience in coding: Awesome! 
These exercises are meant to start from the very beginning, so it should be approachable, but we acknowledge that there might be a non-trivial learning curve that you may not have time for, depending on how late you start your lab writeup. 😉
- You have experience in coding, but not necessarily scientific computing in Python.
For example, maybe you've done scientific computing in MATLAB in ENGR 7 or you've used Python for a traditional course like CS 61A.
Either way, you should find the transition to be smooth and the techniques to be a valuable addition to your toolkit. 💡
- You are a Python god. 
Well, great! You will probably breeze through the data analysis, and we hope we can still offer tips and tricks for advanced users. 💪🏼 -->
