Please let us know!
This is only the first draft and we'd like to hear your feedback.
You can open an issue on GitHub or email Enze (`chenze@`).

We have prepared these **optional** programming exercises to accompany the laboratory procedures in MATSCI 104L.
Completing them is _not_ a requirement for any of the labs and you will _not_ be assessed on programming concepts.
That being said, we hope these exercises can be helpful guides for your data analysis and teach you something new‚Äîmaybe even lead to a grade boost. üí°


## Purpose

Several students who have taken MATSCI 104L in the past have appreciated the hands-on experimental procedures, but wished that there could also be more guidance during the data analysis portion to facilitate the writeup. 
Because we care about your feedback and success in this course, we have tried to accommodate this request, but in the context of **teaching you some data science (DS) and scientific writing (SW)** skills as well.
We believe this will help you complete your lab reports and give you transferable skills that can be applied to other pursuits.


## Learning outcomes 

We hope these exercises will help you grow in the following ways:    
üìä Create some hella nice plots based on effective data visualization principles.      
üìù Incorporate visualizations and statistical analyses of data to strengthen your writing.      
üß∞ Develop basic proficiency with common Python packages‚Äîanother tool to add to your toolbox.

```{admonition} Group work 
:class: note 
It is totally fair game to work together on the analysis, particularly to help each other with Python syntax and debugging.
We hope the online, uniform interface can encourage group work; 
however, please be sure to write your own code, generate your own plots, and complete your own lab writeup with [honesty and integrity](https://teaching.berkeley.edu/berkeley-honor-code).
```

## Usage  

These notebooks are meant to be optional and **self-guided**, where we've included ample instructions and links for your reference.
Try your best to work it out with your labmates/friends, but definitely don't fret over debugging as we want you to focus on learning the MSE knowledge.

That being said, before jumping into the lab exercises, we've created some tutorials that we hope you find helpful.

- If this is your first time using Jupyter Book/Hub (probably most of you):
	- We _strongly recommend_ you look at {doc}`lab0/jbook_usage`.
- If this is _also_ your first time using Python (perhaps some of you):
	- We recommend you then look at {doc}`lab0/intro_python_jupyter_blank`.

Otherwise, you can proceed to {doc}`lab1/lab1` and get started with the plotting tutorial, which _we strongly recommend for everyone_ to establish best practices.
Have fun!
