```{admonition} Questions/comments/ideas?
:class: tip
Let us know!
This is only the first draft and we're happy to hear your feedback.
You can open an issue on GitHub or email Enze (`chenze@`).
```
````

We have prepared these **optional** programmatic data science (DS) exercises to accompany the laboratory procedures in MSE 104L.
Completing them is _not_ a requirement for any of the labs and you will _not_ be assessed on Python/DS in MSE 104/L.
That being said, we hope these exercises can be helpful guides for your analysis and teach you something new—maybe even lead to a grade boost. 💡


## Purpose

````{margin} 
```{admonition} Group work 
:class: note 
It is totally fair game to work together on the analysis, particularly to help each other with coding/debugging.
We hope the online, uniform interface can encourage group work; 
however, please be sure to generate your own plots and complete your own lab writeup with [honesty and integrity](https://teaching.berkeley.edu/berkeley-honor-code).
```
````

Several students who have taken MSE 104L in the past have appreciated the hands-on experimental procedures, but wished that there could also be more structured guidance during the data analysis portion to facilitate the writeup. 
Because we care about your feedback and your success in this course, we have tried to accommodate this request, albeit with a slight twist. 
Namely, we hope to **provide greater clarity for the analysis**, but we will do so in the context of **teaching you some data science** skills as well.
We believe this will help you complete your lab reports and give you transferable skills that can be applied to other pursuits.


## Learning outcomes 

We hope these exercises will help you grow in the following ways: 🌱
- Create some hella nice plots based on effective data visualization principles. 📊
- Apply computational tools to streamline and automate the analysis of MSE data. 🤖
- Develop basic proficiency with common Python packages for DS—another tool to add to your toolbox. 🧰
